1. Consider both storage and robots.
In addition to Manhattan distance between a box and a storage,
the distance between a box and a robot should be also added to the goal.

2. Deadlock detection is the most critical and time-consuming step.
Sometimes a move can lead to unsolvable state, such as trapped in the corner,
these moves must be avoided via deadlock detection.

3. Use cache to improve efficiency.
If no box was moved, there is no need for checking deadlock again, 
the goal can be retrieved from what was previously computed in the cache.
